Lsec

Smart. Simple. Secure.

Hi, I’m a teenage ethical hacker from South Africa, building Lsec to help secure the internet — one vulnerability at a time.

What I Do:

Web & Mobile App Recon

Basic Penetration Testing

Bug Bounty Hunting

Free Website Security Reports (for small businesses)


Tools I Use:

Burp Suite

Termux

Nmap

TryHackMe & Hack The Box

Apktool, jadx (for app analysis)


Why Lsec?

At Lsec, I believe in lightweight but powerful security. I focus on simple, real-world attacks that matter — not just scanning for noise.

Want a Free Scan?

DM me or email cingomartin2@gmail.com for a free vulnerability scan on your website or app.
I’ll send you a short report with what I find — no strings attached.
